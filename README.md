AutoHotkey (v1) script to autofill a form in 10-20 seconds with 1-2 button presses (without needing mouse input).

Inputs patient information (excludes sensitive details) from spreadsheet.
Script also selects parts of the form based on certain values per case such as number of drugs & diagnoses, how each drug is taken, type of case, etc.

Without script, it takes about 1 minute to manually complete each form.
